	<h1>Goa</h1><br>
	<p>Goa is a state in western India with
		coastlines stretching along the Arabian Sea.
		Its long history as a Portuguese colony prior 
		to 1961 is evident in its preserved 17th-century 
		churches and the areaâ€™s tropical spice plantations. 
		Goa is also known for its beaches, ranging 
		from popular stretches at Baga and Palolem to
		those in laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda.
